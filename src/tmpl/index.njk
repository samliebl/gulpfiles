            <p>Hi. Thanks for stopping by. I&rsquo;m Sam and this is my homepage. 90s vibes.</p>
            <p>I work; I write; I draw and do graphic design; I tinker with computer hardware and electronics; I code (at a <em>very</em> basic level, but I&rsquo;m working on it).</p>
            <p>I&rsquo;m not really on any social media except <a href="{{ social.linkedin }}">LinkedIn</a> for work and lately, against my better judgement, <a href="{{ social.instagram }}">Instagram</a> for creative stuff. Oh, and you can also find the music I make on <a href="{{ social.soundcloud }}">Soundcloud</a>. It&rsquo;s instrumental hip hop, usually sample based, if you&rsquo;re into that sort of thing.</p>
            <p>This is me:</p>
